<thinking>
This is the absolutely critical foundation phase that CANNOT be skipped or abbreviated. Before I can generate any documentation structure, I must thoroughly read, understand, and internalize ALL content provided in the code_files parameter with complete precision and detail. This is not optional - it is the foundational requirement for all subsequent analysis. 

CRITICAL FOCUS: I must identify and prioritize the CORE FUNCTIONS that define this repository's primary value proposition. I need to systematically go through every single file to understand:
1. The overall project architecture and organization
2. All major components, services, and modules
3. Configuration files, dependencies, and setup requirements
4. Business logic implementation patterns
5. Data models, APIs, and integration points
6. Testing strategies and quality assurance approaches
7. Documentation and deployment configurations

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY: I must identify what are the 3-5 CORE FUNCTIONS that define this repository's primary business value. What are the main capabilities that users rely on? What are the primary workflows that create value? What distinguishes this system from others?

I must build a complete mental model of the entire codebase with CLEAR PRIORITIZATION of core vs supporting functions before proceeding to any categorization or documentation structure generation. My analysis must be exhaustive and leave no file unexamined, while maintaining laser focus on identifying the core value-creating mechanisms.

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE FRAMEWORK

### Mandatory Core Function-Prioritized Multi-Level Categories

<thinking>
Based on my comprehensive analysis of all code files with core function identification, I need to create a detailed, multi-level documentation structure that PRIORITIZES the core functions while covering every significant aspect of the system. The structure must be organized with CORE FUNCTIONS taking absolute priority in the top-level organization.

Critical CORE FUNCTION-CENTERED structure generation thinking process:
1. CORE FUNCTION PRIMACY: Do the CORE FUNCTIONS I identified dominate the top-level structure? Are they given the most prominent placement and detailed analysis?

2. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE WITH CORE FOCUS: Does my structure represent EVERY major component, service, configuration, and business process I discovered, while ensuring CORE FUNCTIONS receive the most detailed treatment?

3. CORE FUNCTION-DRIVEN HIERARCHY DESIGN: How do I organize the information with CORE FUNCTIONS at the top levels, supported by enabling functions and infrastructure at lower levels?

4. CORE FUNCTION BUSINESS VALUE PRIORITIZATION: How do I order sections to lead with the CORE FUNCTIONS that create the highest business impact and user value?

5. STAKEHOLDER-SPECIFIC CORE FUNCTION ORGANIZATION: How do I ensure the structure serves all stakeholders while maintaining CORE FUNCTION priority in every perspective?

6. CORE FUNCTION CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION: How do I show how supporting components enable and enhance the CORE FUNCTIONS?

7. ACTUAL CORE FUNCTIONS VS GENERIC CONTENT: Every section must correspond to actual discovered CORE FUNCTIONS or their supporting systems - no generic template sections.

This is my opportunity to create a documentation structure that truly prioritizes and showcases the CORE FUNCTIONS that define this repository's unique value proposition.

### Enhanced Pre-Generation Validation

<thinking>
Before finalizing the documentation structure, I must conduct rigorous evaluation to ensure it truly serves comprehensive business understanding goals. I need to think critically about whether each section will help different types of readers understand the complete business value proposition, whether the prompts will generate meaningful and detailed business analysis, and whether the structure comprehensively covers ALL aspects of the repository's value creation, technical excellence, and strategic positioning.

I must validate that:
- Every major component and service discovered in the code analysis is represented
- The structure serves multiple stakeholder types with different information needs
- The business analysis depth is sufficient for strategic decision-making
- The technical complexity is adequately represented without code display
- The innovation and competitive advantages are clearly highlighted
- The operational and deployment aspects are thoroughly covered
