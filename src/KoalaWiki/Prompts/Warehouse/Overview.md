**MANDATORY ANALYSIS-FIRST APPROACH**: You must perform complete repository analysis before writing any documentation. Every statement in your documentation must be derived from actual repository analysis findings.

## Step 1: Repository Data Analysis

<repository_inputs>
- <code_files>{{$code_files}}</code_files>
- <readme_content>{{$readme}}</readme_content>
- <git_repository>{{$git_repository}}</git_repository>
- <branch>{{$branch}}</branch>
</repository_inputs>

Perform systematic analysis of the provided repository data:

### 1.1 Deep Structure Analysis

- **Performance Characteristics**: Identify performance optimizations, scalability patterns, and efficiency measures
- **Security Implementations**: Document security measures, authentication systems, and protection mechanisms

## Step 2: Evidence-Based Documentation Generation

<documentation_rules>
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- **ZERO FABRICATION POLICY**: Every statement must derive from your repository analysis of the provided <code_files>{{$code_files}}</code_files>
- **SOURCE VERIFICATION**: Use ONLY exact file paths discovered in your analysis
- **REAL CODE ONLY**: Quote ONLY actual code snippets found in source files
- **ACTUAL CONFIGURATION**: Reference ONLY real configuration examples from the repository
- **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES ONLY**: Base all feature lists on functionality that EXISTS in the codebase
- **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Provide concrete evidence for ALL claims about the project
- **NO PLACEHOLDER DATA**: Never use example.com, test data, or hypothetical scenarios
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: If you cannot find evidence of a feature in the code, do not mention it

**REPOSITORY UNIQUENESS FOCUS**:
- **Identify Core Innovation**: What specific problem does this repository solve based on ACTUAL implementation?
- **Highlight Technical Excellence**: Advanced patterns found in the ACTUAL codebase
- **Showcase Practical Value**: Real-world applications evident from the ACTUAL code structure
- **Document Implementation Quality**: Code organization patterns found in the ACTUAL repository
- **Emphasize Differentiators**: Features that ACTUALLY exist and set this project apart
- **Avoid Generic Descriptions**: Don't use vague terms without SPECIFIC code evidence

**FORBIDDEN CONTENT**:
- ❌ Hypothetical features or "could be used for" statements
- ❌ Example data like "user@example.com" or "localhost:3000" unless found in actual config
- ❌ Generic technology descriptions not specific to this repository
- ❌ Assumed capabilities not evident in the codebase
- ❌ Placeholder values or mock data
- ❌ Features mentioned in comments but not implemented
</documentation_rules>

## Step 3: Output Format

<output_requirements>
Generate comprehensive documentation within <blog> tags following **GitHub README style**. 

**DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE** (adapt based on repository findings):
1. **Project Title & Tagline**: Compelling title with clear value proposition
2. **Badges Section**: Technology stack, build status, version info (if applicable)
3. **Hero Description**: 2-3 sentences explaining what this project does and why it matters
4. **Key Features Showcase**: Bullet points highlighting unique capabilities and differentiators
5. **Quick Start/Demo**: Immediate value demonstration with code examples or screenshots
6. **Detailed Features**: In-depth feature breakdown with technical specifics
7. **Architecture Overview**: Technical implementation details with mermaid diagrams
8. **Installation & Setup**: Step-by-step setup instructions from actual config files
9. **Usage Examples**: Real code examples demonstrating core functionality
10. **API Documentation**: If applicable, key endpoints and usage patterns
11. **Contributing**: Development setup and contribution guidelines
12. **Technology Stack**: Detailed breakdown of frameworks, libraries, and tools
13. **Code References**: Footnoted links to specific implementation details

**WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Engaging & Professional**: Write like a top-tier open source project README
- **Technical Depth**: Include specific implementation details, not just generic descriptions
- **Developer-Focused**: Assume audience consists of experienced developers
- **Evidence-Based**: Every feature claim backed by actual code references
- **Compelling**: Highlight what makes this project special and worth using

**MANDATORY ARCHITECTURE VISUALIZATION**: Include detailed mermaid diagrams strategically placed throughout the documentation:

1. **High-Level System Architecture**: 
   ```mermaid
   graph TB
       subgraph "Frontend Layer"
           UI[Web Interface]
           API[API Gateway]
       end
       subgraph "Backend Services"
           Core[Core Engine]
           AI[AI Services]
           Git[Git Integration]
       end
       subgraph "Data Layer"
           DB[(Database)]
           Cache[(Cache)]
       end
   ```

2. **Core Processing Pipeline**: Show step-by-step data processing workflows
3. **Service Architecture**: Microservices communication and dependencies
4. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Input → Processing → Output patterns
5. **Deployment Architecture**: Infrastructure and deployment patterns (if applicable)

**DIAGRAM PLACEMENT STRATEGY**:
- Place architecture diagram early (after key features, before detailed setup)
- Use processing pipeline diagrams within feature descriptions
- Include service interaction diagrams in technical implementation sections
- Ensure each diagram adds clear value and isn't just decorative

**CODE REFERENCE SYSTEM**: 
- Use footnote references [^1], [^2], etc. throughout the documentation to reference specific code locations
- At the end of the documentation, provide a "Code References" section with detailed footnotes:
  - Format: `[^1]: [Description]({{$git_repository}}/tree/{{$branch}}/path/to/file#L1-L50)`
  - Include specific line ranges when referencing code blocks
  - Use descriptive names for each reference (e.g., "Main Entry Point", "Service Configuration", "Database Models")
  - Link to actual files found in your repository analysis

**Example Code Reference Usage:**
- In text: "The application starts with dependency injection configuration[^1] and sets up the main services[^2]."
- In footnotes: 
  ```
  [^1]: [Dependency Injection Setup]({{$git_repository}}/tree/{{$branch}}/src/Program.cs#L10-L25)
  [^2]: [Service Configuration]({{$git_repository}}/tree/{{$branch}}/src/Program.cs#L30-L45)
  ```
</output_requirements>
