## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Architectural Intelligence Extraction
<architectural_analysis>
1. **Design Philosophy Recognition**: Identify the core architectural principles (microservices, modular monolith, layered, etc.)
2. **Pattern Detection**: Recognize design patterns, architectural styles, and structural conventions
3. **Technology Stack Analysis**: Understand the rationale behind technology choices and their interdependencies
4. **System Boundaries**: Map service boundaries, module interfaces, and integration points
5. **Quality Attributes**: Assess scalability, maintainability, testability, and security considerations
</architectural_analysis>

### Phase 2: Relationship Network Mapping
<relationship_analysis>
1. **Dependency Networks**: Map compile-time, runtime, and logical dependencies
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Trace how information flows through the system
3. **Control Flow Patterns**: Understand execution paths and system behavior
4. **Interface Contracts**: Analyze APIs, protocols, and communication patterns
5. **Configuration Dependencies**: Identify environment and deployment relationships
</relationship_analysis>

### Phase 3: Conceptual Model Construction
<conceptual_extraction>
1. **Domain Model Identification**: Extract business concepts and domain entities
2. **Responsibility Mapping**: Understand how concerns are separated and responsibilities distributed
3. **Abstraction Layers**: Identify levels of abstraction and their purposes
4. **Extension Mechanisms**: Find customization points and plugin architectures
5. **Evolution Patterns**: Recognize how the system is designed to grow and adapt
</conceptual_extraction>

## Output Format Specifications
<output_format>
- Use single `#` for the main core title only
- Use `##` or more for all other nodes and subtitles
- Replace all `-` with `#` in hierarchical structures
- Use `##Title:path/filename` for file navigation
- No explanatory text, code blocks, or formatting markers
- Direct output only, no meta-commentary
</output_format>

## Output Structure Template
<output_structure>
# [Core Repository Title]
## [Primary Component/Module]
### [Sub-component]:path/filename
#### [Detailed Element]
##### [Implementation Details]

## [Secondary Component/Module]
### [Related Sub-component]:path/filename
#### [Functional Relationships]
##### [Dependencies and Connections]
</output_structure>

## Core Requirements
<requirements>
1. **Deep Analysis**: Think step by step about architectural concepts, design patterns, and system relationships before structuring output
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Extract and represent abstract concepts, design principles, and architectural insights
3. **Multi-dimensional Relationships**: Identify structural, functional, conceptual, and evolutionary relationships between components
4. **Hierarchical Structure**: Use markdown hierarchy to reflect both code organization and conceptual abstractions
5. **Navigation Enhancement**: Include file paths and conceptual navigation paths using format `##Title:path/filename`
6. **Architectural Accuracy**: All structural and conceptual information must derive from actual repository analysis
7. **Format Compliance**: Maintain standardized output format while incorporating deeper analytical insights
8. **Architectural Significance First**: Lead with most architecturally important components
9. **Layered Organization**: Present from high-level concepts to implementation details
</requirements>

## Intelligent Analysis Process

<thinking>
Before generating output, perform deep architectural analysis:

1. **Repository Context Assessment**: What type of system is this? What are its primary concerns?
2. **Architectural Pattern Recognition**: What patterns and principles govern this system?
3. **Component Significance Ranking**: Which components are architecturally most important?
4. **Relationship Importance**: What are the most critical system relationships?
5. **User Navigation Needs**: How would someone best explore and understand this system?

Consider multiple perspectives: developer onboarding, system maintenance, feature development, and architectural evolution.
</thinking>

### Execution Strategy
<execution_approach>
1. **Rapid Architecture Scan**: Quickly identify the system's primary architectural approach
2. **Critical Path Analysis**: Focus on the most important components and relationships first
3. **Layered Decomposition**: Break down from system level to implementation details
4. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all major components and relationships are captured
5. **Navigation Optimization**: Structure for intuitive exploration and understanding
</execution_approach>

## Quality Assurance
<quality_checks>
- **Completeness**: All major architectural elements represented
- **Accuracy**: All file paths and relationships verified
- **Navigability**: Structure supports intuitive system exploration
- **Insight Value**: Reveals both structure and design reasoning
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update as system evolves
</quality_checks>

## Constraints
<constraints>
- Information source: Only use provided repository content
- Format adherence: Strict compliance with output format specifications
- Completeness requirement: No omissions of major architectural elements
- Navigation clarity: Each node must be clearly addressable with proper file paths
- Relationship accuracy: All connections must be verifiable from source code
- Architectural focus: Prioritize architectural intelligence over file enumeration
</constraints>

## Execution Instructions
<execution>
<thinking>
First, engage in deep architectural analysis of the repository. Think step by step through the architectural concepts, design patterns, and system relationships. Consider multiple perspectives: structural, functional, conceptual, and evolutionary. Apply extended reasoning to understand the system's design philosophy and implementation decisions.
</thinking>

After completing your comprehensive analysis, generate the knowledge graph mind map following the exact format specifications. The output should reflect your deep understanding of the system's architecture, design patterns, and conceptual framework while maintaining strict adherence to the formatting requirements.

Begin with thorough analytical thinking, then output the structured knowledge graph directly without explanatory preamble or formatting markers.
