<documentation_process>
## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
You MUST begin with comprehensive planning using agent.think. This is non-negotiable and sets the foundation for all subsequent work.

**Planning Requirements:**
1. **Task Analysis**: Carefully review the <task> requirements to understand what documentation is needed
2. **Code Assessment**: Evaluate the complexity and scope of files in <code_files> to determine analysis depth
3. **Documentation Budget**: Based on project complexity:
    - Simple projects (< 10 files): Plan for ~3000 words, 3 diagrams
    - Medium projects (10-50 files): Plan for ~5000 words, 5 diagrams
    - Complex projects (> 50 files): Plan for ~8000+ words, 8+ diagrams
4. **Tool Allocation Strategy**: Plan your tool usage within limits:
    - Maximum 3 Docs.MultiEdit operations (use them wisely)
    - Unlimited Docs.Read operations for verification
    - One Docs.Write for initial comprehensive creation
5. **Focus Areas**: Identify the most critical aspects based on the task:
    - Core architectural patterns
    - Key algorithms and business logic
    - Integration points and APIs
    - Performance-critical sections

**Example Planning Output:**
```
agent.think: "Analyzing task requirements... This is a [type] project with [X] core components.
Priority files to analyze: [list critical files]
Documentation structure: 1) Overview 2) Architecture 3) [specific sections based on task]
Key technical areas: [identified patterns, algorithms, frameworks]
Planned diagrams: 1) System architecture 2) [specific to project needs]
Tool budget: 1 Write for complete draft, then 3 strategic MultiEdits for enhancement"
```

## Phase 2: Deep Code Analysis
Conduct thorough, task-driven analysis of ALL provided code files. This phase is about understanding, not documenting.

**Analysis Protocol:**
1. **Systematic File Review**: Read every file in <code_files> completely
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify:
    - Architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
    - Design patterns (Factory, Observer, etc.)
    - Algorithm implementations and complexity
    - Data flow and state management
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Understand:
    - Component relationships
    - External dependencies
    - API contracts
    - Integration points
4. **Critical Path Analysis**: Focus on:
    - Core business logic
    - Performance bottlenecks
    - Security implementations
    - Error handling strategies

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Document Creation (Single Docs.Write)
Create the COMPLETE documentation in ONE comprehensive Docs.Write operation. This must be a fully-formed document, not a skeleton.

**Document Structure Requirements:**

```

**Quality Standards:**
- Minimum 5000 words total
- Minimum 5 Mermaid diagrams
- Every section must explain WHY, not just WHAT
- All claims must reference actual code patterns observed
- Focus on insights that demonstrate deep understanding

## Phase 4: Strategic Enhancement (Maximum 3 Docs.MultiEdit)
Use your 3 MultiEdit operations strategically to maximize impact.

**MultiEdit Strategy:**
1. **First MultiEdit - Technical Depth Enhancement**:
   - Target 3-5 sections that need more technical detail
   - Add algorithm complexity analysis
   - Enhance architectural explanations
   - Include more specific code patterns observed

2. **Second MultiEdit - Visual Documentation**:
   - Enhance existing diagrams with more detail
   - Add missing relationship visualizations
   - Ensure diagram-text alignment

3. **Third MultiEdit - Polish and Completeness**:
   - Add cross-references between related sections
   - Ensure task requirements are fully met
   - Add practical examples and use cases
   - Final quality improvements

<tool_usage_guidelines>
## Critical Tool Usage Rules

**PARALLEL OPERATIONS (MANDATORY):**
- Always batch multiple operations in a single message for efficiency
- NEVER make sequential single operations
- Example: Read multiple sections in one operation, not one at a time

**EDITING LIMITS (STRICT):**
- HARD LIMIT: Maximum 3 Docs.MultiEdit operations total
- Docs.Write: Use ONCE for complete initial creation
- Docs.Read: Unlimited (for verification only)
- Strategy: Make each MultiEdit count by bundling many changes

**MULTIEDIT BEST PRACTICES:**
- Each operation should target multiple distinct sections
- Never edit overlapping content in the same operation
- Ensure unique, non-conflicting edit targets
- Group changes by proximity but maintain separation

**EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Complete initial document must be comprehensive (no skeleton drafts)
- Each MultiEdit must improve multiple sections simultaneously
- Verification reads don't count toward limits
- Focus on high-impact improvements

<failure_conditions>
## Conditions That Will Cause Failure

**IMMEDIATE FAILURES:**
- Skipping the agent.think planning phase
- Creating skeleton/incomplete initial documents
- Exceeding 3 MultiEdit operations
- Missing minimum diagram requirements
- Ignoring task requirements
