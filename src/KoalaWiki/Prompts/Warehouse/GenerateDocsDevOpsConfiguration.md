<analysis_framework>
<step_1>
<task>Repository Language Detection and Analysis Strategy</task>
<instructions>
First, analyze the repository catalogue to:
- Detect primary programming languages and frameworks
- Identify infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
- Determine repository architecture patterns
- Assess complexity level and choose appropriate analysis depth
  </instructions>
  </step_1>

<step_2>
<task>Adaptive Analysis Protocol</task>
<instructions>
Based on detected languages and tools, customize your analysis approach:
- For Python/JavaScript repositories: Focus on application architecture, dependencies, and deployment patterns
- For Terraform/CloudFormation: Emphasize infrastructure topology, resource relationships, and security configurations
- For Kubernetes/Docker: Highlight container orchestration, service mesh, and scaling strategies
- For CI/CD configurations: Document pipeline flows, deployment stages, and automation triggers
- For multi-language repos: Provide comprehensive cross-technology analysis
  </instructions>
  </step_2>

<step_3>
<task>Systematic Documentation Generation</task>
<instructions>
Create documentation following this enhanced structure:
1. Executive Summary with key architectural insights
2. Technology stack analysis with rationale
3. Infrastructure topology with dependency mapping
4. Configuration management patterns
5. Security and compliance assessment
6. Operational procedures and troubleshooting
7. Future recommendations and optimization opportunities
   </instructions>
   </step_3>
   </analysis_framework>

<quality_assurance>
<validation_checklist>
- Verify all file references are accurate and accessible
- Ensure diagrams correctly represent actual infrastructure
- Validate security recommendations align with industry standards
- Check that troubleshooting steps are actionable and specific
- Confirm documentation serves both technical and business stakeholders
  </validation_checklist>

<error_prevention>
- Cross-reference configuration files before making architectural claims
- Validate infrastructure diagrams against actual resource definitions
- Ensure security assessments are based on actual configurations, not assumptions
- Test provided code examples and commands for syntax accuracy
- Verify that optimization recommendations are feasible given current architecture
  </error_prevention>

<thinking>
Let me analyze this repository step by step:

1. **Language Detection**: Examining the repository catalogue for primary technologies
2. **Architecture Assessment**: Understanding the overall system design
3. **Configuration Analysis**: Mapping infrastructure and deployment patterns
4. **Security Evaluation**: Identifying security controls and compliance measures
5. **Documentation Strategy**: Tailoring content for the identified technology stack
</thinking>

Generate your documentation using this exact structure, wrapped in <blog> tags: <blog>

<meta_instructions>
When processing repositories in different languages:
- **English repositories**: Use standard technical terminology and comprehensive analysis
- **Non-English repositories**: Detect comment language, adapt technical explanations to be globally accessible, maintain English output as specified
- **Mixed-language repositories**: Prioritize primary codebase language while noting multilingual elements
- **Unknown/minimal documentation**: Rely heavily on code analysis and industry best practices for that technology stack

Remember: Your expertise adapts to the repository's context while maintaining consistent, high-quality documentation standards.
